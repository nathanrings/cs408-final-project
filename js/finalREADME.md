 ## Reflection

 I'm pretty satisfied with how this project turned out. I wasn't able to add all my stretch goals, like the miscellaneous stats or "What If" tab, but the base functionality works very well, and I think the site looks quite nice overall. The API that ESPN has for NFL game results was incredibly convenient for making this site, it was easy to use and definitely saved me some headaches. Adding pages and logos for all 32 teams was tedious, and I'm sure there was probably some more efficient ways to go about that, but it works and I was able to get it done, so I don't mind.
